Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
The logistic model is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc.

In this project we will be working with the UCI adult dataset. We will be attempting to predict if people in the data set belong in a certain class by salary, either making <=50k or >50k per year.
